# ChaseAndroidInterview

Interview problem / coding challenge for Android Developer at CHASE Bank.
This app uses OpenWeatherAPI to display weather data. The search icon takes in locations, but the app
only shows weather for US locations as per the requirements.

What my design looks like is below. The picture is taken on Nexus 4 emulator for kicks.
16dp padding left and right like usual.

The API can give multiple weather reports like light rain and fog, so that is why it is a list.
